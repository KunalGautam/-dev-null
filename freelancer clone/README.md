# Freelancer Clone
Some company hired me to create a clone of freelancer.com website in 20-25 days. As project has big scope and can not be done in above time period, I chalked out what can be done in period of 25 days. Company agreed on it and I started working on it. When I completed the work scope, company denied payment by stating I've get it done by someone else. Hence I'm putting this project under /dev/null
